# Sign Recognition Project

## Overview
This project focuses on real-time sign recognition using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system captures video input from a webcam, processes the frames, and predicts the sign being displayed using a pre-trained CNN model.

## Requirements
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy (numpy)
- Keras (keras)
- scikit-image (skimage)
- Pillow (PIL)
  
You can install them using the following command:  
        
        pip install opencv-python numpy keras scikit-image Pillow
